<h1>Calories</h1>
<h2>What are calories</h2>
<p>Calories are a unit of energy also seen as (kcal) on food packaging. Since they are a form of energy when we consume food our bodies breaks the food down during digestion into a form of energy called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). That energy has to be stored somewhere in the body, as energy cannot be deleted, nor created as defined by the laws of physics.</p>
<h2>Where do calories go exactly?</h2>
<p>Calories are always stored in the body. The 3 major tissues in the body where calories are stored are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fat (adipose tissue)</li>
  <li>Stored carbohydrates (glycogen)</li>
  <li>Muscle</li>
</ul>
<h2>So why are calories so important?</h2>
<p>Calories dictate what our weight does. Whether your weight goes up, down or stays the same is dictated by calories.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you consume more calories than you burn = Weight gain (calorie surplus)</li>
  <li> If you less caloreis than you burn = Weight loss (calorie deficit)</li>
  <li>If consume the same number of calories that you are burning = Maintain weight (maintenance)</li>
</ul>
  
  <p>This means we can easily tell if we are at surplus, deficit or maintenance based on what direction our weight is heading. If we also track our calories, we know the exact number of calories we need to comnsume to gain, lose or maintain.</p>
<h3>How do we figure this out?</h3>
  <p>Well, let's say you're consuming 2,000 calories per day as an easy example.
    
  <p>Your weight stays the same for several days, this means I am at maintenance.</p>

  <p>If I wanted to start losing 0.45kg per week from here I would simply reduce my calorie intake by 500 calories. 
  Why? Because 0.45kg of fat = 3500kcal. If you want to lose 0.45kg per week you would be in a 3500kcal deficit across those 7 days. 
  Simple maths: 500 x 7 = 3,500.</p>

  <p>Why does this happen? Well, when your body is in a calorie deficit it needs to get energy from somewhere to carry out its daily functions. It gets this energy from bodyfat, so you breakdown stored fat, 0.45kg of it = 3,500 calories worth.
  This means in a 500kcal daily for a week, you'd have broken down 0.45kg fat.</p>
